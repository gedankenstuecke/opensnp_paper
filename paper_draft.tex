\section*{Abstract}
Genome-wide association studies are widely used to correlate phenotypic traits with genetic variants like Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms. The advent of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing offers the analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms for an individual at a low cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Genome-wide association studies compare the genetic variation between two groups to find correlations between membership in a group and the genetic variation. To find significant correlations it is necessary to have a large enough sample size. Over 100.000 people already got themselves genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing and could be a valuable data source for association studies. However, generally this data is not public for various reasons and thus can’t be used by other scientists. Here we present a survey which evaluates if people are willing to publicly share their genetic information. In the light of those results we also present the web-platform openSNP. It is an open approach which allows participants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data along with phenotypic information into the public domain. Through this crowdsourced effort of collecting genetic and phenotypic information we create a valuable resource which can be used in a wide array of studies, included Genome-wide association studies.

\section*{Introduction}

The availabilty of new DNA sequencing techniques has shifted the focus of biological data acuisiton towards new biomedical applications.
Many diseases – for example Alzheimers, Parkinsons or different types of cancers – are at least partly heritable and thus the genome 
of patients can be used for diagnostic purposes. Using the genetic information of patients is made possible through the sharp decrease in costs for analysing genetic information. 
Thus the importance genetic information in biomedicine will/may increase over the next years and may become a standard tool for diagnostics.

The comparison of DNA sequences from individuals in a population can reveal variable sites, which are of major interest in investigating diseases. 
A variation of only one nucleotide length at a given site is called a single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). 
The different nucleotides at this site are defined as an allele.
For diploid organisms, as us humans, the genotype at a given site consists of two alleles, which are independently inherited from each parent.
Different methods have been developed to read SNPs in an individual, a
process called genotyping. A widespread used method for genotyping individuals is the use of microarrays.
In comparison to whole genome sequencing only sites which are known to be variable are analysed, making microarrays cheaper and faster \cite{Brown1999}. 


If the genotypes for more then one individual are known, the analysis of
allele frequencies can be used to associate SNPs with diseases and other inheritable traits. Genome-Wide Assocation Studies
(GWAS) make use of statistics to compare the alleles of patients to the alleles of healthy controls. This
enables GWAS to find alleles which are significantly overrepresented in patients and associate them with a disease.
This method does not allow inference of causal differences but merely identifies correlations. 
The first GWAS was published in 2005 and compared age-related macular degeneration in contrast 
to a healthy control group \cite{Klein2005}. Since the beginning, the number of participants in 
such studies has been rising: Over 1200 GWAS have been performed \cite{Johnson2009} and over 
5000 SNPs have been linked to different diseases and traits in those studies \cite{Hindorff2009}. 
%(http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageid=26525384&clearquery=1#result_table)  

Since 2006, companies like 23andMe, deCODEme or FamilyTreeDNA have been offering Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing. 
Those companies use DNA microarrays to screen for around 1 million SNPs spread over the human genome. In return, customers 
get an analysis of the results, as well as a file that includes the customer's raw individual genotypes. In 2011, 23andMe 
alone had over 100,000 customers\footnote{http://spittoon.23andme.com/2011/06/15/23andme-2011-state-of-the-database-address/} 
- the company recognizes the potential to perform GWAS with this amount of data by using surveys to ask their customers about 
traits and diseases. With the consent of the customer the data is used for association studies. 23andMe has published several 
articles in which it replicates known findings, but also finds new associations for Parkinson's Disease \cite{Eriksson2010, Do2011}. 
Over 30,000 23andme-customers have participated in those association studies.  

Although companies like 23andMe are willing to use the data for scientific research,
it is not easy for individual scientists to access the data. 
The generation of biomedical data by private companies raises concerns about privacy \footnote{https://www.23andme.com/about/privacy/}, 
liabilty and consent \cite{Caulfield2011}. 
Nevertheless, individual customers are willingly sharing their data. Most do so by uploading their data to
their personal website or to open software repositories like \textit{GitHub}. 
This data is scattered and unorganized, making it hard to use this information. While projects like SNPedia try to keep track of all 
the genotyping files \cite{Cariaso2011}, they do not provide the information necessary to perform GWAS, as the phenotypic information is 
most often not attached to the genetic information. Projects that attach the phenotype to the genetic information, 
like the \textit{Personal Genome Project}, still don't allow for an easy re-use of the data, as they lack an advanced programming interface (API) 
or other methods by which researchers could download the data and not every customer of DTC genetic testing can participate in it.  

We designed an online survey to evaluate the support in the personal genetics community for a crowdsourced online plattform. Here we present the results of the survey in combination with the openSNP project. 
The openSNP project is an online platform, which makes it possible for DTC customers to share genotypic and phenoytypic information and connect it with external data sources. 
The data is made available to research via a Creative-Commones-Zero licence.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Survey on Sharing Genetic Information}
In total 229 people, 180 with a self-reported chromosomal sex of XY and 56 with a self-reported chromosomal sex of XX participated in our survey on sharing genetic information with the public. 
The mean age of the participants is 33 (SD = 11,29). 81.7 \% reported their ethnicity as caucasian. 39.7 \% of the participants are already 
customers of at least one DTC genetic testing company and further 30.1 \% of them plan on becoming one in the future. 29.7 \% don't plan on 
becoming a DTC customer. There is no significant difference in the usage of DTC companies between chromosomal sexes (Cramer's V = 0.077). 

67.7 \% of all participants would share their data with their DTC-company without any constraints, 25.8 \% would do so given the company 
didn't share the data with third parties. 6.6 \% of the participants would not share their data. Participants self-identified as XX-chromosomal are slightly more likely to answer that DTC companies are allowed to use their results (Cramer's V = 0.221). Those who are a customers of a DTC company or are planning on becoming one in 
the future are more likely to share their results, compared to those who don't plan on getting themselves genotyped (Somers-d = 0.331). 

There are substantial differences in terms of motivation, tested by Tukey's HSD test, between those people who have already been genotyped 
and those who are not planning on getting genotyped. The first group is likely to agree more strongly, on a five-point scale, with the following 
motivations for sharing genotypic information: because they want to help scientists (mean difference = 0.465, SE = 0.128), 
because they think of personal benefits (mean difference = 0.448, SE = 0.183) and because they are curious (mean difference = 1.159, SE = 0.193). 

On the other hand, those people who are not planning on getting genotyped are more likely to agree with the following motivations 
for not sharing their data: because they fear discrimination (mean difference = 1.060, SE = 0.195), because they feel 
it is a breach of their privacy (mean difference = 0.821, SE = 0.225), because they fear negative consequences for their 
family members (mean difference = 0.733, SE = 0.21) or because they fear personalized advertising (mean difference = 0.848, SE = 0.208).

Similarly, those people who would share data with their DTC provider under any circumstances are likely to agree more strongly with 
the following motivations for sharing than those who would not share their data with their DTC company: because they want to help 
scientists (mean difference = 1.57, SE = 0.199), because they think of personal benefits (mean difference = 0.951, SE = 0.308), 
and because they are curious (mean difference = 1.99, SE = 0.321). In the case of curiosity as a motive, there is also a substantial difference between those who would share their data with their DTC company under the condition that it did not share the information and those who would not (mean difference = 1.116 SE = 0.344) as well as those who would share under any circumstances (mean difference = -0.874 SE = 0.182).

Those participants who are not willing to share data with their DTC company are likely to agree more strongly with the following motivations 
for not sharing their data when compared to those who would share their data with their DTC company under any circumstances: because they 
fear discrimination (mean difference = 1.52, SE = 0.322), because they feel it is a breach of their privacy (mean difference = 1.871, SE = 0.324), 
because they fear consequences for their family members (mean difference = 1.146, SE = 0.32) and because they fear personalized advertising (mean difference =  1.112, SE = 0.357). In the cases of fear of discrimination and fear of a breach of privacy, substantial differences between all three categories exist: Those who would share their data with their DTC company as long as it did not share the information agree less strongly than those who would not share the data with both fear of discrimination as a motive for not sharing (mean difference = -0.615, SE = 0.345) as well as fear of a breach of privacy (mean difference = -0.668, SE = 0.346). Those who would share their data under any circumstances are even less likely to agree with these motives than those who would share only if their DTC company did not share the information (fear of discrimination: mean value = -0.906, SE = 0.182; breach of privacy: mean difference = -1.203, SE = 0.183).

\subsection*{openSNP}

The openSNP project (http://opensnp.org) is an open, crowdsourced online platform for both DTC customers and researchers. 
DTC customers are encouraged to share their genotyping results and connect them with phenotypes to enable GWAS for researchers,
but the data can also be used for other research and in any other context.  
Users can create a personal profile, discuss SNPs and phenotypes on the 
platform using a simple commenting system, or send each other private messages. 


\subsubsection*{Sharing genotypic information}
Currently users can upload their genotypings from the companies 23andme, deCODEme and FamilyTreeDNA via a webinterface to the openSNP 
project. The uploaded data is published under the Creative Commons Zero-license, 
which - in accordance with the Panton Principles (doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195) - 
allows a complete reuse of the data without any constraints.
Between the start of openSNP on 09/27/2011 and 12/18/2012, 214 people have signed 
up with openSNP, and 79 genotyping files were made available. The openSNP 
database lists 69,486,471 SNPs, which are distributed over 1,938,603 unique SNP-IDs.
Figure \ref{Figure1_label} depicts the increase of users and genotyping files over time.


\subsubsection*{Crowdsourcing phenotypes}
Beside uploading genotypic data, users may create new phenotypes that are not yet 
listed by openSNP. 
The specification of these phenotypes is open and not limited 
to pre-defined categories. To reduce the amount of manual data curation, openSNP tries to harmonize 
the expression and spelling of the same phenotype or variation. We implemented an 
autocompletion-feature, which helps users to reuse already entered phenotypes.
Users are encouraged to list as many phenotypes as possible through a simple 
achievement system, rewarding users that upload their data and enter phenotypic 
information with small badges that are shown on their profile pages.

In the same timeframe that was mentioned above, all users combined have 
entered a total of 675 variations on 47 different phenotypes with those variations being 
the different values on a given trait or phenotype. See figure \ref{Figure1_label} for the increase of phenotypic information over time.

The mean number of users that have entered their variations for a single phenotype 
is 14.36 (SD 12.65), the median is 10. The distribution of how many users have 
entered their data per phenotype can be seen in figure \ref{Figure2_label}. The phenotype provided 
by the most users is the eye color, which has been entered by 54 users. There are 
two phenotypes which have so far only been provided by a single user: 
The SAT Writing score and triglyceride-levels.


\subsubsection*{Connection to external services}
In order to provide users with relevant information on their respective genotypes, openSNP scans databases of the scientific literature for specific SNPs. 
A total number of 15,229 documents relevant to the SNP-IDs listed in openSNP could be found in the databases of Mendeley, the Public Library of Science and SNPedia. 
Of the primary literature, 25 \% are released in open access journals and can be accessed free of charge by every user (Figure \ref{Figure3_label}). For usability reasons, 
SNPs are ranked by the amount of information gathered by the external services. The external services themselves are ranked by how easily users can access information 
from these sources. The SNPedia entries are given the highest impact, as those are already manually curated, followed by open access publications out of 
the Public Library of Science. Lowest values are given to the Mendeley results, as those aren't necessary freely available to every user. 
An entry on SNPedia is valued 2.5 times as high as a PLoS publication and 5 times as high as a Mendeley entry.  

\subsubsection*{Data access}
OpenSNP offers extensive access to the data uploaded by users. Anyone can download single genotyping files for specific users, get archives of multiple genotyping files 
grouped by phenotypic variation, or access a single download that includes all genotyping files and all phenotypes in a comma-separated table. The genetic data is also 
accessible through the Distributed Annotation System, which offers all data for specific chromosomes and specific positions on single chromosomes. 
The data is additionally available over a JSON-API, which allows users to directly access data in the JSON-format.


\section*{Discussion}

\subsection*{Survey issues}
As the survey was taken online by voluntary participants and was mainly spread in the personal genetics community, 
the results do not reflect the general population, but overrepresent those people most likely to be interested in
a project such as openSNP: customers of DTC genetic testing companies and people with a high interest in biology. 
As we wanted to find out about interest in crowdsourcing GWAS and about how people who had purchased DTC genetic 
testing felt about sharing their data with third parties, this approach was warranted.

\subsection*{GWAS and open data}
Although prices of exome or even full genome sequencing are dropping rapidly, GWAS tend to stay considerably cheaper 
and offer a possibility of getting insight into genetic variations, for example SNPs which are linked to different traits 
on a population level. 

Despite this benefit in terms of cost GWAS can only detect correlations of SNPs with those traits and don't allow 
inference on the cause for any correlation. Furthermore, GWAS need a large enough sample size, 
which has to be statistically analysed by using sound methods. 
Nevertheless, GWAS are still frequently used and new associations are found \cite{10.1371.journal.pone.0031470,10.1371.journal.pone.0030309,10.1371.journal.pone.0029848}. 

One way of bringing down costs for GWAS even further is to make use of already available genotyping results and datasets. 
Data produced by DTC genetic testing companies is a promising source for such data, as such companies already have high 
numbers of customers which are willing to pay for the genotyping by themselves.

By crowdsourcing the acquisition of genetic and phenotypic data, openSNP faces the same problems as any other 
open platform on the Internet, namely the need to trust users regarding the data they upload and enter on openSNP. 
Additionally, the quality of the data varies, especially in terms of accuracy on the phenotypic variation, 
with users entering data in different measurement systems. While we try to suggest similar entries to the users, 
there are some cases where users wont follow those suggestions, so duplicates or similar phenotypes or variations in traits may arise. 

There are two possible solutions to this problem: One could only allow some (trusted) users to enter new phenotypes or one 
could make users enter all possible variations of a phenotype while creating a new phenotype, so that later users can't add 
variations that have not been available from the start. Both methods have a disadvantage: In either case it makes it harder 
for users to enter their data and thereby raises the bar for participation, which ultimately could lead to less data entered. 
Facing this trade-off, we decided to keep data entry as easy as possible, at the cost of forcing users who want to perform GWAS 
with the data to perform more quality control.

Another risk regarding data quality that should be kept in mind is a possible bias in data availability on openSNP, as we cannot 
rule out the possibility that only an unrepresentative subset of people buy DTC genetic testing, from which an even smaller subset 
is willing to publish the results, along with phenotypic information of medical relevance.

With openSNP, we have built a platform that can be used by customers of DTC genetic testing to easily share their genetic and phenotypic 
data with a wide audience, as well as by scientists and interested citizens who are looking for datasets to be used in GWAS. 
Customers of DTC genetic testing also benefit from an easy access to primary literature on SNPs and genetic variations they carry. 
While we don't have collected enough data to perform full scale GWAS yet, this might be possible in the future, as user numbers are rising. 

\subsection*{Privacy and health implications and ethical considerations}
As we have found in the survey on sharing such results, many of these customers are also willing to share their results with scientists and 
the public to help scientific progress, although people who have taken DTC genetic testing are considering the privacy implications that come 
with openly sharing those results.      

The advent of DTC genetic testing has led to new ethical and social issues. Much of the critique on DTC genetic testing focusses on the practice 
of delivering medical information without consulting a physician or genetic counselor to help patients/customers make sense of the information 
and to put the new knowledge to good use \cite{Hauskeller2011,Hogarth2008,Wasson2009}. Less attention has been paid to the privacy implications 
that come with this cheap way of obtaining genetical information \cite{Caulfield2011,Joh2011}. 

With a move towards making one's own genetic and medical information public, it becomes clear that the issue of privacy needs to get a closer look. 
Our survey has shown that people are concerned about their privacy and fear that stakeholders like employers, insurance companies, governments 
or advertisers might misuse the information. Policy makers start to react to those changes by introducing laws like the 
\textit{Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act} in the United States or the \emph{Gendiagnostikgesetz} in Germany to minimize the impact of
widely available genetic information. DTC genetic testing companies themselves also try to educate their customers about the risks of releasing genetic data.  

We openly address the problem of privacy implications that come with releasing genetic data twice, during registration for openSNP and during 
the upload of the DTC genetic testing results. Users have to confirm that they have read and understood the disclaimer about possible side-effects 
that can arise by publishing their data. To further improve this process we are working on implementing informed consent-processes,
like the one by \textit{Consent for Research} (http://www.weconsent.us).

\section*{Materials and Methods}
\subsection*{Survey on Sharing Genetic Information}
The survey was performed using Google Docs and was distributed to possible participants through the 23andMe community, the DIYBiology mailing list, 
blogs which focus on genetics and DTC genetic testing and social media like Twitter, Google Plus and Facebook.  

The survey included demographics such as age, chromosomal sex and ethnicity of the participants. Furthermore, it included questions on their 
(planned) customership of a DTC company. If the participants already were customers, they were also asked if they were already sharing their genetic and phenotypic data. 
All participants were asked if they would share their genetical or phenotypic information with their DTC company, possible answers were "Yes", "Yes, 
but only if they did not share my medical information with anybody else" and No".

The survey also asked some scaled questions which measured how strongly participants agreed/disagreed with different reasons for sharing or not sharing their 
information with third parties. The scale went from 1 = strongly disagree over 3 = neutral to  5 = strongly agree. Motivations queried for sharing data 
were "because I want to help scientists with their research", "because of possible personal benefits (e.g. getting treatments for a disease I have, 
possibility of new medication, etc.)", "because it may deliver advertising that is relevant to me" and "out of curiosity". Motivations queried for not sharing 
data were "because advertisers could use the information for targeted campaigns", "because of possible negative consequences for closely related persons", 
"because of the breach of my privacy" and " because of the fear of discrimination (e.g. by the employer, the state, some insurance company)". 
Additionally, participants had the possibility of giving their own reasons for sharing or not sharing their data.

The survey data was analyzed with SPSS 19. 

\subsection*{Technical realization of the platform}
The main platform is realized using the web framework Ruby on Rails 3.0.10. Postgres 9.2 is used as the main database backend for Rails. 
The database stores genotyping results, users' phenotypic information, literature results from Mendeley and the Public Library of Science as well as summaries on SNPs 
which can be found in SNPedia. The literature database of Mendeley is queried using the REST API, which delivers results in JSON. The literature database of 
the Public Library of Science is queried using the respective REST API, which delivers results in an XML-format. Summaries on SNPs are provided by SNPedia, 
through querying the content via the MediaWiki API. All databases are queried using the unique identifier of each SNP as the search term. 

SNPs are catalogued by their unique identifier, which consists of a prefix (mostly \textit{rs}, rarely \textit{i}) and a unique number. This is a common format, 
which is employed by the NCBI dbSNP database and is also widely used and easily parsed from different literature sources. Publications from the different databases as 
well as the users' genotypes are associated with individual SNPs by the Rs-ID. Allele and genotype frequencies are updated regularly, based on the data present in openSNP. 

Processes with a longer runtime, such as parsing the genotyping results, creating archives of results which are to be mailed to users and queries to external resources 
are handled using the ruby gem Resque and the standalone server Redis. Search features on the platform itself are implemented using Solr and the ruby gem Sunspot. 
Additionally, data can be requested from openSNP using the Distributed Annotation System \cite{Dowell2001,Jenkinson2008}. The required data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.  
Requested data is delivered in XML-format to facilitate parsing. Additionally, users can request data in the JSON-format, using a system not specified in any standard.

OpenSNP only serves as a platform for SNPs, so methods for the delivery of nucleotide sequences as described in the DAS-standard are not implemented. Currently, 
two methods are implemented: \textit{features}, which is used to deliver SNPs located on specific chromosomes or between specific nucleotide positions, 
based on the user's query. The second method is \textit{sources}, which advertises all DAS-sources for all genotypes present in openSNP.

A flowchart of all services incorporated in openSNP and of all the ways users can upload or access the data is given in figure \ref{Figure4_label}. The source code of openSNP is 
published under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 and can be downloaded at http://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr. The genetical and phenotypical data is licensed under Creative Commons Zero.
